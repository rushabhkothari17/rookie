- [x] Mandatory `currency` field on all products (Shadcn Select in ProductForm)
- [x] Orders and Subscriptions store `currency` (transaction) + `base_currency` (partner base) + `base_currency_amount` (FX-converted)
- [x] **FX Conversion**: Real-time rate via `open.er-api.com` (free, no API key needed)
  - `base_currency_amount` stored in every order/subscription for export purposes
  - Fallback to 1:1 rate if external API is unavailable
  - **1-hour in-memory TTL cache** on FX rates (no per-request latency)
- [x] All 6 currency dropdowns use Shadcn Select (fixed from broken native `<select>`)
- [x] Partner signup: no labels, placeholders only, base_currency Shadcn Select
- [x] **Service cards** (`OfferingCard`, `ProductCard`) use `product.currency` via `Intl.NumberFormat` — shows £, CA$, €, $ correctly

- [x] `base_currency_amount` auto-included in Orders/Subscriptions CSV exports

### P1 — Cleanup & Verification (COMPLETED 2026-02-27)

- [x] **Final Code Deprecation (COMPLETE)**: Removed `quote_requests` artifacts from permissions.py, integrations.py, oauth.py, gdpr_service.py, imports.py (ALL dicts), and dropped collection via server.py migration
- [x] **Cart Validation**: Type + currency enforcement — `CartContext.addItem()` returns string|null with descriptive errors; only one product type and one currency allowed per cart
- [x] **ProductForm**: Subscription toggle hidden for `external` and `enquiry` pricing types
- [x] Multiple payment methods (Card, Bank Transfer, GoCardless)
- [x] Terms & Conditions acceptance
- [x] **Currency display**: prices shown with product currency code (e.g., EUR 99.00 instead of $99.00)
- [x] **Partner tag / override code flow removed** completely
- [x] Checkout payload no longer sends partner_tag_response or override_code

### Currency System (NEW 2026-02-26)

- [x] **Resources scope-final**: Currency field alongside price
- [x] **Manual orders/subscriptions**: Currency selector (auto-fills from product)
- [x] **Audit logs**: Include currency and base_currency in details
- [x] **Payment processors**: Pass product currency to Stripe and GoCardless

## Completed in Latest Session (2026-02-25)
1. ✅ Cart UI/UX complete redesign
2. ✅ Scope ID moved to Cart (from product pages)
3. ✅ **Admin UI restructured**:
   - Products tab: +Promo Codes, +Terms sub-tabs
   - Articles tab: +Override Codes sub-tab
   - Main sidebar: +Email Templates, +References, +Custom Domains
   - Website Content: -Payments, -Bank Transaction Form, -Email, -References, -Domains
4. ✅ Product editing fixed (API endpoint corrected)
5. ✅ Cart spacing increased

## Completed in Latest Session (2026-02-26) — Bug Fixes
1. ✅ **P2 Recurring Bug Fixed (3rd+ time, now closed):** "Edit Article" button was visible to `partner_super_admin` because `user?.is_admin` is `true` for all admin roles. Changed to `user?.role === 'platform_admin'` in `ArticleView.tsx` line 14. Verified: platform_admin sees button ✓, partner_super_admin does NOT see button ✓.
2. ✅ **Duplicate tenant `automate-accs` deleted:** Removed tenant (id: `3e50877e-...`) + 1 user, 1 product, 1 category, 1 article, 1 website_settings, 1 terms doc, 1 email template. Original `automate-accounts` intact.

## Completed in Latest Session (2026-03-[current]) — Security Audit & Hardening

### Security Audit Results (All 10 checks PASS)
1. ✅ Platform admin login via legacy endpoint (no partner_code) works correctly
2. ✅ `partner_login` with `automate-accounts` code is BLOCKED (403) — hardcoded guard added
3. ✅ `customer_login` with `automate-accounts` code is BLOCKED (403)
4. ✅ Customer `register` with `automate-accounts` partner_code is BLOCKED (403)
5. ✅ Create tenant with `automate-accounts` code is BLOCKED (400) — explicit hardcoded guard added
6. ✅ Create partner admin user under platform tenant is BLOCKED (403) — `is_platform` check added
7. ✅ Platform admin can list ALL tenants (unrestricted access)
8. ✅ Platform admin has unrestricted customer access across all tenants
9. ✅ Platform admin has unrestricted order access across all tenants
10. ✅ Unauthenticated access to admin endpoints is blocked

### Security Code Changes Made
- `backend/routes/auth.py` — `partner_login`: Added explicit block for `automate-accounts` code
- `backend/routes/auth.py` — `register_partner`: Hardcoded check added (loop also skips reserved code)
- `backend/routes/admin/tenants.py` — `create_tenant`: Hardcoded block for `automate-accounts` code
- `backend/routes/admin/tenants.py` — `create_partner_admin`: Block creating users under platform tenant
- `backend/server.py` — `seed_admin_user()`: Added `role: "platform_admin"` and `tenant_id: None` to ensure correct role on new deployments

### Access Control Architecture (Confirmed Secure)
- `platform_admin` role: Bypasses all tenant filters → sees ALL data
- `partner_super_admin/admin/staff`: Strictly scoped to their `tenant_id`
- `platform_admin` check: Via `is_platform_admin()` function (role == "platform_admin")
- `X-View-As-Tenant` header: Only honored for `platform_admin` role
- Admin endpoints: Use `get_tenant_admin` → `require_admin` + tenant scoping
- Tenant management: Uses `require_platform_admin` — strictly `platform_admin` only
- `platform_admin` role: Cannot be assigned via admin API (excluded from allowed_roles in user CRUD)

## Completed in Latest Session (2026-03-current) — Articles→Resources Refactor & Platform Admin Overhaul

### What Was Done
1. ✅ **Articles renamed to Resources** everywhere: DB collections, backend routes, frontend files, UI text
2. ✅ **Platform Admin unscoped view**: Admin sees all data from all tenants (Customers, Users, Products, Resources, Orders, Subscriptions) — achieved by removing `tenant_id` filter for `platform_admin` role in all list endpoints
3. ✅ **"Partner" column** added to all admin tables (Customers, Users, Products, Resources, Orders, Subscriptions) — only visible when logged in as `platform_admin`
4. ✅ **Default country fixed** in Create Customer dialog: was `"GB"`, now empty
5. ✅ **Admin sidebar reordered**: "Partner Orgs" now appears before "Users"
6. ✅ **Data enrichment**: `enrich_partner_codes` helper in `backend/core/tenant.py` injects `partner_code` into every admin list response
7. ✅ **ResourceView isAdmin fix**: Extended to include `super_admin` and `partner_super_admin` roles
8. ✅ **`_DT` NameError fixed** in `resources.py` get_article_by_id
9. ✅ **All-Tenants ResourceView** fixed for platform admin (tid=None when no X-View-As-Tenant header)
10. ✅ **SetupChecklistWidget** updated: "Create an article" → "Create a resource"
11. ✅ **DB fix**: admin@automateaccounts.local role corrected to `platform_admin`

### Architecture Changes
- `backend/core/tenant.py` — `enrich_partner_codes()` helper function added
- `backend/routes/resources.py` — replaces articles.py, platform-admin-unscoped
- `backend/routes/resource_categories.py` — replaces article_categories.py
- `backend/routes/admin/customers.py`, `users.py`, `orders.py`, `catalog.py`, `subscriptions.py`, `references.py`, `requests.py`, `terms.py`, `promo_codes.py`, `logs.py` — all enriched with `partner_code`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ResourcesTab.tsx` — exports `ResourcesTab` (was `ArticlesTab`)
- `frontend/src/pages/Resources.tsx`, `ResourceView.tsx` — public resource pages
- DB collections renamed: `articles`→`resources`, `article_categories`→`resource_categories`, `article_templates`→`resource_templates`, `article_email_templates`→`resource_email_templates`

### Test Results (iteration_110.json)
- All 10 features tested: 100% PASS
- Platform admin login, Partner columns, multi-tenant data, Resources pages all confirmed working

## Session: 5 QA-Driven Bug Fixes (2026-03-current)

1. ✅ **Promo Code Product-Scope Enforcement** — `store.py` validate endpoint now rejects promos when `applies_to_products=selected` and cart contains ineligible product IDs. Also added `product_ids` to `ApplyPromoRequest` model.
2. ✅ **ZOHOR Sponsorship Note** — When promo code contains "ZOHOR": validate returns `is_sponsored: true`; checkout `notes_json` includes `sponsorship_note`; Cart UI shows amber sponsorship banner. Fixed `/promo/validate` → `/promo-codes/validate` URL mismatch in Cart.tsx.
3. ✅ **Category Rename Cascade** — `admin_update_category` now runs `products.update_many` to update all linked products when category name changes.
4. ✅ **Category Delete Button UX** — Delete button is now `disabled` with a tooltip ("N product(s) linked — reassign them first") when `product_count > 0`. Uses Tooltip component from shadcn/ui.
5. ✅ **Customer Registration partner_code in body** — Added `partner_code: Optional[str]` to `RegisterRequest` model; auth.py register uses `partner_code or payload.partner_code` so both query param and body field work.

## Future Tasks (P2)
- Centralized email integration settings
- Credential forms for "Coming Soon" integrations
- Formal penetration testing
- Verify complex intake form visibility (`AND`/`OR` operators)
- Catalog field ↔ UI layout linkage summary

## Enquiries System (Merged 2026-02-26)
- Old "Quote Request" flow (quote_requests collection, /products/request-quote) REMOVED
- Unified "Enquiries" system uses orders with type="scope_request"
- New admin `Enquiries` tab (replaces "Requests") at `/admin` → Commerce → Enquiries
- Backend: GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/enquiries endpoints
- Frontend: EnquiriesTab.tsx with status management, detail view, filter by email/status/date
- ProductDetail.tsx: enquiry products now show "Request a Quote" button → scope modal, fixed "Calculating pricing..." indefinitely bug
- Cart.tsx: RFQ "Enquiries" section uses /orders/scope-request-form
- ScopeRequestFormData: all fields now optional; added name/email/company/phone/message

## Email Notifications for Enquiries (2026-02-26)
- `enquiry_customer` template: sent to customer on every enquiry submission with full summary (products, order number, message/project summary)
- `scope_request_admin` template: updated - now includes company, phone, products, message alongside all scope fields
- Both emails fire on `/orders/scope-request-form` (form-based) and `/orders/scope-request` (cart-based)
- Email uses active provider per tenant (Zoho Mail or Resend); falls back to email_outbox (mocked) if not configured
- WebsiteTab > Forms: now shows ONE "Enquiry Form" tile (merged from 2)
- All product modals (quote + scope) now use unified `scope_form_schema`
- ensure_seeded: now upserts available_variables on system templates on each startup

## QA Pass — Resources/Articles, Categories, Override Codes, References, Scope Unlock, Enquiry Flow (2026-02-26)
- Full QA via testing agent iteration_115.json — 53/53 backend tests passed (100%), 95% frontend
- BUG-1 CRITICAL fixed (by testing agent): `references.py` public endpoint `NameError` — `admin` variable used outside auth scope; removed incorrect `enrich_partner_codes` call
- BUG-2 CRITICAL fixed (by testing agent): `ProductDetail.tsx` called `/articles/${scopeId}/validate-scope` (404 always) — updated to `/resources/${scopeId}/validate-scope`
- MINOR fixed: Cart "No purchasable items" message now context-aware — shows "Enquiry items are shown below…" when scope/enquiry items exist
- MINOR fixed: Resource audit logs (created/updated/deleted) now use `create_audit_log` service (includes tenant_id) instead of raw `db.audit_logs.insert_one`
- All NON-NEGOTIABLE INVARIANTS VERIFIED: tenant isolation ✅, Scope Final price enforcement ✅, audit trail with tenant_id ✅, email templates all present ✅


- Full QA via testing agent iteration_114.json
- BUG-1 CRITICAL fixed: `promo_code_data` NameError in bank-transfer subscription checkout (checkout.py line 133) — was crashing subscription checkout via bank transfer
- BUG-2 LOW fixed: Fee badge in OrdersTab always showing `fee: —` even for zero-fee orders — now only shows when fee > 0
- BUG-3 LOW fixed: Cart.tsx fallback stripe_fee_rate was 0.029 (2.9%) — corrected to 0.05 (5%) to match backend SERVICE_FEE_RATE
- All NON-NEGOTIABLE INVARIANTS VERIFIED: tenant isolation ✅, 5% fee ✅, notes_json MERGE ✅, payment authority server-side ✅, audit trail ✅


- `/app/test_reports/iteration_13.json` — Pre-merge catalog tests
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_14.json` — Promo note tests
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_112.json` — Enquiries merge tests (100% backend)
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_113.json` — Email notification tests (77% backend, email flow verified)
